        the ones who have the
        ability to vanish all our fears, insecurities and blues away just with their smile. We can count on them to
        share
        what we feel like, to take an opinion on some matter and even to convince our parents for something – they would
        do
        anything to see us happy, healthy and hearty. So, one can quite guess why they need to be made special on their
        born
